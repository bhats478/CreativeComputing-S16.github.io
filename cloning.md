# Forking and Cloning assignments

Go to the github repository for the assignment and click on the Fork button:

It might take a second to finish...

Once it's done it will take you to the copy of the assignment folder that is now part of your account. It looks really similar but you'll see your username in the upper left-hand corner.

Now you can clone it to your desktop by clicking on the computer icon with the arrow:

This will open up the GitHub desktop app. Generally you'll want to keep the folder name the same, but you can change where it gets saved to:

This is what it looks like once you've cloned to desktop:

Right-click (or control-click) on the name of your repository and open it in Atom to start working on your assignment.

You can open files inside the project folder by clicking on them in the left sidebar.


## Saving your changes to github

Remember, saving your files on your comuter doesn't automatically save them to GitHub. In order to sync your folder with GitHub you have to do the following steps:

Open git-control in Atom from  `Packages > git-control > Toggle`

Make sure all your files are checked off. Most will be by default, but if you added any new files such as images you'll need to click on those to check those on:

Time to commit your changes. Commits are like saving a new version of a project. By doing so it allows you to go back to this version if you accidentally delete something important later on.

Click on the commit button:

It will prompt you to write a commit message about what changes you've made. Keep it short.

You're not done yet! You've commit the changes to your computer but now you have to upload those changes to GitHub.com. Click on the Push button.

It will ask you what branch. Don't worry about this step. Most of the time you'll be pushing to the gh-pages branch. Click "push."

You're done!

If you're not sure it worked, you can always double check by going to your repository on your github page and looking at when the last commit was.
